## GPU Galaxy Project

This program runs an n-body simulation that computes the forces on each
object in parallel on the GPU.

To run the program, navigate to the GPUGalaxy folder, compile it and run
with these commands:

```
cd GPUGalaxy
make
./galaxyGPU
```

A window should pop up with a black screen. Clicking in this space creates
a randomly generated galaxy of stars. Click more times to generate more
galaxies and observe how the stars interact with one another. You can move
using the arrow keys to observe stars that move outside the window.
